<p>
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both <br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
    And looked down one as far as I could <br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>
    </p>
<p>
    Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim  <br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear,  <br>
    Though as for that the passing there  <br>
    Had worn them really about the same,  <br>
</p>
<p>
    And both that morning equally lay  <br>
    In leaves no step had trodden black.  <br>
    Oh, I kept the first for another day!  <br>
    Yet knowing how way leads on to way  <br>
    I doubted if I should ever come back.  <br>
</p>
<p>
    I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
    Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>    
    I took the one less traveled by, <br>
    And that has made all the difference.
